# Airplane-Type-Detection-System

# What does it do?
The model shall identify which aircraft is in the image provided by a user.
The website uses a trained CNN model.


## Things to improve on:
Currently, the model has poor accuracy due to some images not being appropriate labels for certain aircraft and only using 20 images for each aircraft.

Currently, Model 1 is under development, which should address some of the above issues:
1.  Removing images that are not appropriate labels for each name
2.  Adding an additional 50 images for each aircraft from different websites.
